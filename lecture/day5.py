# QUESTION:
'''You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game. These are the rules of the FizzBuzz game:

Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include number 100.
But when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
e.g. it might start off like this:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz'''

# SOL:
# for i in range(1,101):
#     if (i%3==0):
#         print("Fizz")
#     elif (i%5==0):
#         print("Buzz")
#     elif (i%3==0) and (i%5==0):
#         print("FizzBuzz")
#     print(i)
